#### Compiling a C code with external libraries is done by entering the following line of codes:
For example:
	cc main.o -L. -lahfrican -o prog

The command cc main.o -L. -lahfrican -o prog is used to compile a C program that depends
on an external library called "ahfrican". Let's break down the command and understand its components:

	cc: This is the command to invoke the C compiler. It stands for "C Compiler" and is 
	commonly used on Unix-like systems.

	main.o: This is the object file that contains the compiled code for the main
	function of the C program. The .o extension indicates that it is an object file.

	-L.: This option tells the compiler to search for libraries in the current directory (.).
	The -L flag is followed by the directory path.

	-lahfrican: This option specifies the name of the library that the program depends on. 
	The -l flag is followed by the library name without the lib prefix and the file extension. 
	In this case, the library name is "ahfrican".

	-o prog: This option specifies the output file name for the compiled program. The -o
	flag is followed by the desired name for the executable file. In this case, the name is "prog".


When you run this command, the C compiler (cc) will compile the main.o file and link it with 
the ahfrican library. The resulting executable file will bbe named "prog".

It's important to note that for this command to work correctly, the main.o file and the ahfrican library file should be 
present in the current directory. If they are located in different directories,
you may need to provide the appropriate paths.

In summary, the command cc main.o -L -lahfrican -o prog is used to compile a C program that depends
on the "ahfrican" library and produce an executable file named "prog".
