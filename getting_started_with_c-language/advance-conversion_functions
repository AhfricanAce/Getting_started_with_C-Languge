In C, conversion functions are used to convert one data type to another. They allow us to change the representation of 
data from one type to another, which can be useful in various programming scenarios.

C provides several conversion functions that can be used to convert between different data types. 
These functions are typically used when we need to perform operations on data of different types 
or when we want to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type.

See 8-advance-conversion_functions.c for examples and other explanations.
