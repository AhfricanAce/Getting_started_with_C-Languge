Explanation of printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
This is a code line in C programming language.

printf(): In C programming language, the printf() function is used to print formatted output to the console.
i.e. it allows us to display values or messages on the screen during program execution.

"a+b = &d \n": This is the format string that specifies the desired output format.
In this case, it contains a combination of text and a format specifier %d.

%d: This is a format specifier used to indicate that an integer value will be printed at 
that postion in the format string.

\n: This is an escape sequence that represents a newline charcter, which moves the cursor to the next line after printing the output.

The format string "a+bb = %d \n" contains the text "a+b =" followed by the format specifier %d.
The %d is a placeholder that will be replaced by the value of the variable c when the printf 
function is executed.

Assuming that the variable c holds the sum of two numbers a and b, the printf function will print
the result of the addition in the specified format. For example, if a 9, b is 4, and c is the sum of a and b, the output will be: a+b = 13

PS: The %d format specifier is used specifically for integers. If you want to print other types of values, such as floating-point numbers or characters, you would use a different format specifiers
like %f or %c, respectively.
