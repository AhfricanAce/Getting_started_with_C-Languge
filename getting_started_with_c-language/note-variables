In C programming, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. It is used to 
store and manipulate data durung program execution. Variables are an essential part of any programming language,
as they allow us to store and retrive data as needed.

In C, variables must be declared before they can be used. The declaration specifies the variable's name and its data type.
The data type determines the kind of data that can be stored in the variable, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or arrays.

See example of declaring and using a variable in C:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int age; // declaration of an integer variable named 'age'

	age = 25; // assigning a value to the 'age' variable

	printf("My age is %d\n", age); // printing the value of the 'age' variable

	return 0;
}

In this example, we declare an integer variable named 'age' using the 'int' data type. 
We then assign the value 25 to the 'age' variable using the assignment operator '='.

However, variables in C can be modified by assigning new values to them. For example:

age = 30; // asssigning a new value to the 'age' variable

It is important to note that variables in C have a scope, which determines where they can be accessed.
The scope os a variable can be global or local. Global variables are declared outside of any function and can be accessed
by any function in the program. Local variables are declared within a function and can only be accessed within that function.
