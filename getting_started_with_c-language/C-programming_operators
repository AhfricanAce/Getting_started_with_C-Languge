/* # C Programming operators.*/

# Note:

/* An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. 
For example: + is an operator to perform addition.*/

/*C has a wide range of operators to perform various operations.*/

# C Arithmetic Operators:

/*An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subbtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables)*/

You might be wondering 'What are constants and variabbles?':

Constants are usually written in numbers. Variables are specially written in letters or symbols. Constants usually represent the known values in an equation, expression or in line of programming. Variables, on the other hand, represent the unknown values.

Example:
+	addition or unary plus
-	subtraction or unary minus
*	multiplication
/	division
%	remainder after division (modulo division)
