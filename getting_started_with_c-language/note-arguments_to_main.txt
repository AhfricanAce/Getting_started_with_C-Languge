In the C programming language, the main function is the entry point of a program. 
it is where the program execution begins. The main function can accept command-line arguments,
which are passed to it when the program is executed.

The main function has two common forms:

FORM 1:

int main(void)

FORM 2:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

The first form, int main(void), indicates that the program does not accept any command-line arguments.
This is the simplest form of the main function and is commonly used when the program does not require
any input from the user.

The second form, int main(int argc, char *argv[]), indicates that the program accepts command-
line arguments. The argc parameter represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the 
program, and the argv parameter is an array of strings that contains the actual arguments.
