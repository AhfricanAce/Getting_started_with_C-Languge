One important concept to understand when working with pointers is the concept of pointer arithmetic.
Since pointers store memory addresses, you can perform arithmethic operations on them. 
For example, you can increment or decrement a pointer,
which will move it to the next or previous memory location, respectively.

See 11-pointer_arithmetic for examples:
