Char data types in C language is used to represent characters and small integers.
By defualt, char is considered to be an unsigned data type, meaning it can only represent positive values or zero.
However, in some cases, we may need to represent oth positive and negative values using the char data type.

The signed char data ia s variation of the char data type that allows for the representaion of both posotive and negative values, extending the range of values that can e stored
in a char variable by usung one it to represent the sign of the value.
This means that a signed char can store values ranging from -128 to 127.

Syntax for declaring a signed char variable in C:

signed char mychar;

You can  also initialize a signed char variable at the time of declaration:

signed char mychar = -10;

When working with a signed char variable, you can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, just like with any other numeric data type. The sign of the result will be determined based on the operands and the operation being performed.
