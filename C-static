# Creating a Static Library In C Language.

To create a static library in C language, you can use the ar command, which stands for "archiver"â€”
The ar command is commonly used to create and manage static libraries in Unox-like systems.

To create a static library named libahfrican.a from objecct files util_file.o, util_net.o, and 
util_math.o, you can use the folllowing command:

ar rc libahfrican.a util_file.o util_net.o util_math.o

#### Let's Break Down The Command:

ar: This is the command itself, used to create and manage static libraries.
rc: These are options for the ar command:
	r: This option tel ar to insert the object file into the library or replace existing files.
	c: This option tells ar to create the library if it doesn't exist.

libahfrican.a: This is the name of the static library you want to create. You can choose any name you like,
but it's common to prefix it with "lib" and use the .a extension to indicate that it's a static library.

util_file.o util_net.o, and util_math.o: These are the object files that you want to include in the library.
Object files are compiled versions of your source code files (.c files) and contain  the machine code for the 
functions and variables defined in those files.

After running the ar command, you will have a static library named libahfrican.a that contains the object files util_file.o, util_net.o, and util_math.o. You can then use this library in your C programs by linking against it during the
compilation process.

To link against the libahfrican.a library, you can use the -l option followed by the library name when compiling your C 
program. For example:

gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -L/path/to/library -lahfrican

In the above command, -L/path/to/library specifies the directory where the libahfrican.a library is located,
and -lahfrican tells the compiler to link against the libahfrican.a library.

By creating a static library, you can easily reuse common code across multiple C programs without having to recompile
the code evry time. This can help improve code organization, reduce duplication, and make your programs more modular
and maintainable.
